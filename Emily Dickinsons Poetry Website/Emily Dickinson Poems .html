            { title: "The Lost Jewel", content: `I held a jewel in my fingers\nAnd went to sleep.\nThe day was warm, and winds were prosy;\nI said: "'T will keep."\n\nI woke and chid my honest fingers,\nThe gem was gone;\nAnd now an amethyst remembrance\nIs all I own.` },
            { title: "A Book", content: `There is no frigate like a book\nTo take us lands away,\nNor any coursers like a page\nOf prancing poetry.\n\nThis traverse may the poorest take\nWithout oppress of toll;\nHow frugal is the chariot\nThat bears a human soul!` },
            { title: "The Wind's Visit", content: `The wind tapped like a tired man,\nAnd like a host, "Come in,"\nI boldly answered; entered then\nMy residence within\n\nA rapid, footless guest,\nTo offer whom a chair\nWere as impossible as hand\nA sofa to the air.\n\nNo bone had he to bind him,\nHis speech was like the push\nOf numerous humming-birds at once\nFrom a superior bush.\n\nHis countenance a billow,\nHis fingers, if he pass,\nLet go a music, as of tunes\nBlown tremulous in glass.\n\nHe visited, still flitting;\nThen, like a timid man,\nAgain he tapped—'t was flurriedly—\nAnd I became alone.` },
            { title: "A Thunder-Storm", content: `The wind begun to rock the grass\nWith threatening tunes and low,—\nHe flung a menace at the earth,\nA menace at the sky.\n\nThe leaves unhooked themselves from trees\nAnd started all abroad;\nThe dust did scoop itself like hands\nAnd throw away the road.\n\nThe wagons quickened on the streets,\nThe thunder hurried slow;\nThe lightning showed a yellow beak,\nAnd then a livid claw.\n\nThe birds put up the bars to nests,\nThe cattle fled to barns;\nThere came one drop of giant rain,\nAnd then, as if the hands\n\nThat held the dams had parted hold,\nThe waters wrecked the sky,\nBut overlooked my father's house,\nJust quartering a tree.` },
            { title: "Beclouded", content: `The sky is low, the clouds are mean,\nA traveling flake of snow\nAcross a barn or through a rut\nDebates if it will go.\n\nA narrow wind complains all day\nHow some one treated him;\nNature, like us, is sometimes caught\nWithout her diadem.` },
            { title: "Summer Shower", content: `A drop fell on the apple tree,\nAnother on the roof;\nA half a dozen kissed the eaves,\nAnd made the gables laugh.\n\nA few went out to help the brook,\nThat went to help the sea.\nMyself conjectured, Were they pearls,\nWhat necklaces could be!\n\nThe dust replaced in hoisted roads,\nThe birds jocoser sung;\nThe sunshine threw his hat away,\nThe orchards spangles hung.\n\nThe breezes brought dejected lutes,\nAnd bathed them in the glee;\nThe East put out a single flag,\nAnd signed the fête away.` },
            { title: "If I Can Stop One From Breaking", content: `If I can stop one heart from breaking,\nI shall not live in vain;\nIf I can ease one life the aching,\nOr cool one pain,\n\nOr help one fainting robin\nUnto his nest again,\nI shall not live in vain.` },
            { title: "A Word", content: `A word is dead\nWhen it is said,\nSome say.\nI say it just\nBegins to live\nThat day.` },
            { title: "The Railway Train", content: `I like to see it lap the miles,\nAnd lick the valleys up,\nAnd stop to feed itself at tanks;\nAnd then, prodigious, step\n\nAround a pile of mountains,\nAnd, supercilious, peer\nIn shanties by the sides of roads;\nAnd then a quarry pare\n\nTo fit its sides, and crawl between,\nComplaining all the while\nIn horrid, hooting stanza;\nThen chase itself down hill\n\nAnd neigh like Boanerges;\nThen, punctual as a star,\nStop—docile and omnipotent—\nAt its own stable door.` },
            { title: "The Bee is Not Afraid of Me", content: `The bee is not afraid of me,\nI know the butterfly;\nThe pretty people in the woods\nReceive me cordially.\n\nThe brooks laugh louder when I come,\nThe breezes madder play.\nWherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?\nWherefore, O summer's day?` },
            { title: "As Children Bid the Guest Goodnight", content: `As children bid the guest good-night,\nAnd then reluctant turn,\nMy flowers raise their pretty lips,\nThen put their nightgowns on.\n\nAs children caper when they wake,\nMerry that it is morn,\nMy flowers from a hundred cribs\nWill peep, and prance again.` },
            { title: "A Day", content: `I'll tell you how the sun rose,—\nA ribbon at a time.\nThe steeples swam in amethyst,\nThe news like squirrels ran.\n\nThe hills untied their bonnets,\nThe bobolinks begun.\nThen I said softly to myself,\n"That must have been the sun!"\n\nBut how he set, I know not.\nThere seemed a purple stile\nWhich little yellow boys and girls\nWere climbing all the while\n\nTill when they reached the other side,\nA dominie in gray\nPut gently up the evening bars,\nAnd led the flock away.` },
            { title: "The Pedigree of Honey", content: `The pedigree of honey\nDoes not concern the bee;\nA clover, any time, to him\nIs aristocracy.` },
            { title: "The Grass", content: `The grass so little has to do,—\nA sphere of simple green,\nWith only butterflies to brood,\nAnd bees to entertain,\n\nAnd stir all day to pretty tunes\nThe breezes fetch along,\nAnd hold the sunshine in its lap\nAnd bow to everything;\n\nAnd thread the dews all night, like pearls,\nAnd make itself so fine,—\nA duchess were too common\nFor such a noticing.\n\nAnd even when it dies, to pass\nIn odors so divine,\nAs lowly spices gone to sleep,\nOr amulets of pine.\n\nAnd then to dwell in sovereign barns,\nAnd dream the days away,—\nThe grass so little has to do,\nI wish I were the hay!` },
            { title: "Perhaps You'd Like to Buy a Flower", content: `Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,\nBut I could never sell.\nIf you would like to borrow\nUntil the daffodil\n\nUnties her yellow bonnet\nBeneath the village door,\nUntil the bees, from clover rows\nTheir hock and sherry draw,\n\nWhy, I will lend until just then,\nBut not an hour more!` },
            { title: "The Moon", content: `The moon was but a chin of gold\nA night or two ago,\nAnd now she turns her perfect face\nUpon the world below.\n\nHer forehead is of amplest blond;\nHer cheek like beryl stone;\nHer eye unto the summer dew\nThe likest I have known.\n\nHer lips of amber never part;\nBut what must be the smile\nUpon her friend she could bestow\nWere such her silver will!` },
            { title: "Evening", content: `The cricket sang,\nAnd set the sun,\nAnd workmen finished, one by one,\nTheir seam the day had begun.\n\nThe grass, divided by the scythe,\nThe stubble, stiff with dew,\nThe hills, in purple samplers laid,\nThe evening, too.\n\nThe bobolink passed, and then the bee,\nAnd I, with my spade,\nThe garden's little citizen,\nWent out to help the shade.` },
            { title: "Autumn", content: `The morns are meeker than they were,\nThe nuts are getting brown;\nThe berry's cheek is plumper,\nThe rose is out of town.\n\nThe maple wears a gayer scarf,\nThe field a scarlet gown.\nLest I should be old-fashioned,\nI'll put a trinket on.` },
            { title: "The Butterfly's Day", content: `From cocoon forth a butterfly\nAs lady from her door\nEmerged—a summer afternoon—\nRepairing everywhere,\n\nWithout design, that I could trace,\nExcept to stray abroad\nOn miscellaneous enterprise\nThe clovers understood.\n\nHer pretty parasol was seen\nContracting in a field\nWhere men made hay, then struggling hard\nWith an opposing cloud,\n\nWhere parties, phantom as herself,\nTo Nowhere seemed to go\nIn purposeless circumference,\nAs 't were a tropic show.\n\nAnd notwithstanding bee that worked,\nAnd flower that zealous blew,\nThis audience of idleness\nDisdained them, from the sky,\n\nTill sundown crept, a steady tide,\nAnd men that made the hay,\nAnd afternoon, and butterfly,\nExtinguished in its sea.` },
            { title: "Fringed Gentian", content: `God made a little gentian;\nIt tried to be a rose\nAnd failed, and all the summer laughed.\nBut just before the snows\n\nThere came a purple creature\nThat ravished all the hill;\nAnd summer hid her forehead,\nAnd mockery was still.\n\nThe frosts were her condition;\nThe Tyrian would not come\nUntil the North evoked it.\n"Creator! shall I bloom?"` },
            { title: "The Snow", content: `It sifts from leaden sieves,\nIt powders all the wood,\nIt fills with alabaster wool\nThe wrinkles of the road.\n\nIt makes an even face\nOf mountain and of plain,—\nUnbroken forehead from the east\nUnto the east again.\n\nIt reaches to the fence,\nIt wraps it, rail by rail,\nTill it is lost in fleeces;\nIt flings a crystal veil\n\nOn stump and stack and stem,—\nThe summer's empty room,\nAcres of seams where harvests were,\nRecordless, but for them.\n\nIt ruffles wrists of posts,\nAs ankles of a queen,—\nThen stills its artisans like ghosts,\nDenying they have been.` },
            { title: "The Sea", content: `An everywhere of silver,\nWith ropes of sand\nTo keep it from effacing\nThe track called land.` },
            { title: "Forbidden Fruit", content: `Forbidden fruit a flavor has\nThat lawful orchards mocks;\nHow luscious lies the pea within\nThe pod that Duty locks!` },
            { title: "The Woodpecker", content: `His bill an auger is,\nHis head, a cap and frill.\nHe laboreth at every tree,—\nA worm his utmost goal.` },
